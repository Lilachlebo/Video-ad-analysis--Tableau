# Video-ad-analysis--Tableau
Exploring trends in video ads across time and region.
I work as a video ad analyst at the Sterling & Draper advertising agency. 
I devote a lot of time to analyzing trending videos on YouTube to determine what content deserves marketing attention.
Each video has a specific category (Entertainment, Music, News & Politics, etc.), region, and trending date.
A video can be in the trending section for several days in a row.
Every week, the employees Melanie and Ashok ask me the same questions:
•	What video categories were trending last week?
•	How were they distributed among various regions?
•	What categories were especially popular in the United States?
Eventualy, I decide that it's time the process was automated. 
Here is a presentation and dashboard.
